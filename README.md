## Struggles / Incomplete 
Not using NextJs before was a bit of a stuggle, but there are many tutorials and videos I was able to find along with the documentation that was really helpful.  I am also using tailwindCss for the first time in this project and I am not sure I LOVE the inline styling. Tailwind was super easy to pick up which I liked, but some of the inline styling seems a bit much.  I would definitely have cleaned that up if I had more time.  I did start to incorporate a login/logout that I found in a tutorial, but I was not able to get it to completely get it to work in the timeframe that I had.  This is something I will definitely go back and finish in my own time.  Overall, I am pretty happy with my solution.
